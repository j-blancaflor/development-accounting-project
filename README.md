# Project Description

This project investigates cross-country income inequality using data provided by the most recent version of the Penn World Table. It is an attempt to update a similar exercise as seen in Caselli (2003). The investigation analyzes economic factors (hours worked, capital stock, human capital) affects the variation in y, where y is given by the production function as given in Hall & Jones (1999).

# Lessons Learned

This was my first project in Python and helped me learn the basics of programming after 4 years away. My language I attempted to learn was C++. I didn't make much progress, but it introduced me to concepts that were ended up being familiar to me during this project. Overall, this project is still rough around the edges, and could have been written way better. However, it still introduced me to programming in Python its data analysis capabilities. Here is the short of what I learned:

* Essential programming concepts (variables, loops, conditionals)
* Reading data from CSVs and processes to clean it
* Using the NumPy library
* Plotting graphs using MatplotLib library
